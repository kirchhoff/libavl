 * \brief Generic AVL-tree library.
 * \version 0.9.1
 *
 * Implementation of an AVL tree to store generic data.
 * In computer science, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree,
 * and it was the first such data structure to be invented. In an AVL tree,
 * the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
 * Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take \f$\mathcal{O}(\log n)\f$
 * time in both the average and worst cases, where \e n is the number of
 * nodes in the tree prior to the operation. Insertions and deletions may
 * require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations.
 *
 * The AVL tree is named after its two Soviet inventors, G.M. Adelson-Velskii
 * and E.M. Landis, who published it in their 1962 paper "An algorithm for the
 * organization of information."
 *
 * The balance factor of a node is the height of its left subtree minus the
 * height of its right subtree (sometimes opposite) and a node with balance
 * factor 1, 0, or âˆ’1 is considered balanced. A node with any other balance
 * factor is considered unbalanced and requires rebalancing the tree. The
 * balance factor is either stored directly at each node or computed from the
 * heights of the subtrees.
 *
 * \section Usage Use of library
 *
 * Library needs implementation of two function
 * \arg \c \b avl_data_cmp: this function is used to compared data stored in tree.
 * \arg \c \b avl_data_print: this function is used only for debug to print tree.
 * \arg \c \b avl_data_delete: this function is used to delete data stored in tree.
 *
 * To create a new tree, first use \c \b init_dictionnary function. It return
 * a pointer to a tree structure.
 *
 * To add element in tree, use \c \b insert_elmt with a pointer to data to add.
 *
 * To get data stored in the tree, use \c \b get_data with a pointer to data to
 * look for with only key data fill in the structure.
