 * \brief Generic AVL-tree library.
 * \version 1.0.0
 *
 * Implementation of an AVL tree to store generic data.
 * In computer science, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree,
 * and it was the first such data structure to be invented. In an AVL tree,
 * the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
 * Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take \f$\mathcal{O}(\log n)\f$
 * time in both the average and worst cases, where \e n is the number of
 * nodes in the tree prior to the operation. Insertions and deletions may
 * require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations.
 *
 * The AVL tree is named after its two Soviet inventors, G.M. Adelson-Velskii
 * and E.M. Landis, who published it in their 1962 paper "An algorithm for the
 * organization of information."
 *
 * The balance factor of a node is the height of its left subtree minus the
 * height of its right subtree (sometimes opposite) and a node with balance
 * factor 1, 0, or âˆ’1 is considered balanced. A node with any other balance
 * factor is considered unbalanced and requires rebalancing the tree. The
 * balance factor is either stored directly at each node or computed from the
 * heights of the subtrees.

 * This function return an initilized tree.
 *
 * \note By default, if you do not provide function usefull to the tree,
 * the LibAVL library uses its own function. As LibAVL does not know exactly
 * the structure and the definition of your data, result can not be as good
 * as expected. Details on these functions are given in the following.
 *
 * \section LibAVL internal data function
 *
 *    - Compare function: by default, the internal \c data_cmp function will
 *      return the difference between the two pointer given in arguments
 *
 *          return (int) ((ptrdiff_t) a - (ptrdiff_t) b);
 *
 *      The \c data_cmp function is really critical and guarantee efficiency of
 *      LibAVL.
 *    - Print function: by default, the internal \c data_print function will
 *      print the addresse contained in pointer in argument, in hexadecimal
 *
 *          printf("0x%08x\n", d);
 *
 *      Since \c data_print is mainly used as debug function to dump a complete
 *      tree, it is not the most important data function, but with the correct
 *      implementation, it could save lots of time and money when something
 *      went wrong.
 *    - Delete function: by default, the internal \c data_delete function will
 *      call \c free on the argument pointer. If your data is only a static
 *      structure or a simple type, this function is enough. But for bigger
 *      object like a string array, it is necessary to provide a new
 *      \c data_delete function to avoid memory leak.
