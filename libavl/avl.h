 * \brief Generic AVL-tree library.
 * \version 1.0.0
 *
 * Implementation of an AVL tree to store generic data.
 * In computer science, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree,
 * and it was the first such data structure to be invented. In an AVL tree,
 * the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
 * Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take \f$\mathcal{O}(\log n)\f$
 * time in both the average and worst cases, where \e n is the number of
 * nodes in the tree prior to the operation. Insertions and deletions may
 * require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations.
 *
 * The AVL tree is named after its two Soviet inventors, G.M. Adelson-Velskii
 * and E.M. Landis, who published it in their 1962 paper "An algorithm for the
 * organization of information."
 *
 * The balance factor of a node is the height of its left subtree minus the
 * height of its right subtree (sometimes opposite) and a node with balance
 * factor 1, 0, or âˆ’1 is considered balanced. A node with any other balance
 * factor is considered unbalanced and requires rebalancing the tree. The
 * balance factor is either stored directly at each node or computed from the
 * heights of the subtrees.
 *
 * \section Usage Use of library
 *
 * Here is an example of code that store structure in AVL tree:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  #include <stdlib.h>
 *  #include <stdio.h>
 *  #include "avl.h"
 *
 *  // Structure we want to store
 *  // key is used to order data
 *  struct data {
 *      int key;
 *       int value;
 *   };
 *
 *   // Function that compares two struct data
 *   int data_cmp(void *a, void *b)
 *   {
 *       struct data *aa = (struct data *) a;
 *       struct data *bb = (struct data *) b;
 *
 *       // Protect against NULL pointer
 *       // It could generally never happened
 *       if (!aa || !bb)
 *           return 0;
 *
 *       return aa->key - bb->key;
 *   }
 *
 *   // Function that dumps data structure
 *   void data_print(void *d)
 *   {
 *       struct data *dd = (struct data *) d;
 *
 *       if (dd)
 *           printf("{ %d => %d }\n", dd->key, dd->value);
 *   }
 *
 *   // Function that delete a data structure
 *   void data_delete(void *d)
 *   {
 *       struct data *dd = (struct data *) d;
 *
 *       if (dd) {
 *           // You can put here all additional needed
 *           // memory deallocation
 *           free(dd);
 *       }
 *   }
 *
 *   int main(int argc, char *argv)
 *   {
 *       tree *avl_tree = NULL;
 *       struct data tmp;
 *       int result;
 *
 *       // Initialize a new tree with our three previously defined
 *       // functions to store data structure.
 *       avl_tree = init_dictionnary(data_cmp, data_print, data_delete);
 *
 *       tmp.key = 42;
 *       tmp.value = 4242;
 *
 *       // Add element {42, 4242} in our tree.
 *       result = insert_elmt(avl_tree, &tmp, sizeof(struct data));
 *       // Here result is equal to 1 since there is only 1 element in tree.
 *
 *       // Dump tree to stdout with data_print function
 *       print_tree(avl_tree);
 *
 *       // For all search function, the only value needed in tmp structure
 *       // is key field.
 *       tmp.key = 20;
 *       tmp.value = 0;
 *
 *       if (!is_present(avl_tree, &tmp))
 *           printf("Key 20 is not found.\n");
 *
 *       tmp.key = 42;
 *       if (is_present(avl_tree, &tmp))
 *           printf("Key 42 exist in tree.\n");
 *
 *       if (get_data(avl_tree, &tmp, sizeof(struct data)))
 *           printf("Now, tmp.key is equal to 4242\n");
 *
 *       delete_node(avl_tree, &tmp);
 *       if (!is_present(avl_tree, &tmp))
 *           printf("Key 42 does not exist anymore.\n");
 *
 *       // Free all memory
 *       delete_tree(avl_tree);
 *
 *       return 0;
 *   }
 *   </pre>
 *
 * You can find this example in folder \b example.
 *
 * \subsection Tree initialisation
 *
 * To start a new tree, you need to init a new one with function
 * \b init_tree.
 *
 * \subsection Manage data
 *
 * The libavl provide all necessary function to store, retrieve and
 * browse your data. The following set gives basic operation:
 *  * \b insert_elmt
 *  * \b is_present
 *  * \b get_data
 *  * \b delete_node
 *  * \b delete_node_min
 *
 * Moreover, libavl gives the availability to browse your entire data
 * or a subset of your data with:
 *  * \b explore_tree
 *  * \b explore_restrain_tree
 *  * \b print_tree
 *
 * Finally, libavl take care of your memory and deallocate all memory
 * used in a tree when you want to destroy it with \b delete_tree.

 *
 * \note By default, if you do not provide function usefull to the tree,
 * the LibAVL library uses its own function. As LibAVL does not know exactly
 * the structure and the definition of your data, result can not be as good
 * as expected. Details on these functions are given in the following.
 *
 * \section LibAVL internal data function
 *
 *    - Compare function: by default, the internal \c data_cmp function will
 *      return the difference between the two pointer given in arguments
 *
 *          return (int) ((ptrdiff_t) a - (ptrdiff_t) b);
 *
 *      The \c data_cmp function is really critical and guarantee efficiency of
 *      LibAVL.
 *    - Print function: by default, the internal \c data_print function will
 *      print the addresse contained in pointer in argument, in hexadecimal
 *
 *          printf("0x%08x\n", d);
 *
 *      Since \c data_print is mainly used as debug function to dump a complete
 *      tree, it is not the most important data function, but with the correct
 *      implementation, it could save lots of time and money when something
 *      went wrong.
 *    - Delete function: by default, the internal \c data_delete function will
 *      call \c free on the argument pointer. If your data is only a static
 *      structure or a simple type, this function is enough. But for bigger
 *      object like a string array, it is necessary to provide a new
 *      \c data_delete function to avoid memory leak.
